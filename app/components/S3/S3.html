                            <h1>What Are <em>Emotions?</em></h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>First and foremost, you should recognize that emotions are really nothing more than a sensory system. They are the eyes and ears of your body… gauges of your biology. The brain is a huge endocrine gland that secretes behavior and emotions. The emotions and behavior that are excreted have a biological basis. But it’s not like putting a dipstick into the motor of your car to see what the oil level happens to be. You can’t put your finger in your ear or up your nose, and then look at it to measure the amount of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or serotonin in your brain. More often than not, the negative emotions reflect the perception of unmet needs; there is a problem which gives rise to anger or fear. But it’s very important to realize that the emotion itself is not the problem. Emotions are nothing more than symptoms or indicators of a problem.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Many people make the mistake of believing that the emotion is the problem. They go to the bookstore and purchase a volume proclaiming to have the solution for vanquishing your anger or for reducing your fear. That’s all well and good. By all means, take steps to reduce the anger or the fear that impedes your productivity or blocks your capacity for pleasure. However, at the same time, recognize that if all you do is put a pharmacological or behavioral Band-Aid on the emotion, the problem that led to that emotion will resurface at some other time, perhaps in the form of a derailed immune system, or, possibly, in the form of intestinal upset, skin disease, memory loss, or heart problems. There are a wide number of illnesses that will more readily occur when your body has been altered by emotional upheaval. These now become the answer to the question: I know what to do, so why can’t I do it?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are no fewer than 558 words in the English language alone that have emotional connotations. Some people consider all of these 558 words to be individual emotions. Of course, that gets a bit unwieldy. In contrast, the British philosopher John Locke argued that there are really only two emotions: those that give rise to pain and those that give rise to pleasure.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The negative emotions are those that are associated with a threat or with the blocking of a goal. The positive emotions, on the other hand, are associated with making progress toward a goal. Is it that simple? Are emotions just good or bad? Is it really that clear-cut? What do you believe?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The ancient Greeks would have argued that all emotions are good; that the ability to express virtually every emotion is essential for the good life. A counterpoint was promoted by the Stoics, who argued that it was a waste of time to experience emotions, especially joy and love, which were considered frivolous. And you can’t blame them. Life was absolutely chaotic during that era in ancient history. It really was a waste of time to be joyful because there was so little about which to be joyful. The belief that emotions are inherently bad was driven home during the Middle Ages. Realize that at that time, they didn’t use the word emotion. Instead, the word passion was used. Nonetheless, passion, or, what today we would call emotion, was very closely intertwined with sin, focusing on words like greed, lust, and envy. To this day, this historical perspective has influenced our cultural beliefs concerning emotions. Despite evidence to the contrary, emotions often are believed to be inherently bad, which may be why many people deny or repress them.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You’ve heard the expressions - you’ve probably used them yourself: Don’t be so emotional. Chill out. Be more reasonable. The implication is that emotions are the opposite of reason; that if you express the emotions that you have, somehow, you have lost control. Not only is this a cultural belief; it may be a hand-me-down belief, as well. It may well explain the reluctance of some people, especially men in Western society, to express their feelings.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Why do some people avoid emotions? People do things for one of two reasons: to avoid pain or to experience pleasure. If a child has a traumatic experience as a result of being punished for expressing anger, she will associate anger with pain, and it will be avoided. If a boy is brought up in an environment where he is taught that the male is the one who always should be strong and in charge, the experience and expression of fear may erode that self-image. So the emotion and the circumstances that might give rise to it are avoided.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In many instances, if you are uncomfortable with the expression of a certain emotion, you may very well align yourself with an individual who also feels uncomfortable with expressing the same emotion. Whether in the workplace or in the family, you reinforce each other and behave in a way that each of you feels comfortable with by avoiding the same emotion.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In other cases, opposites may attract. You may be drawn to a person who is able to express an emotion that you feel uncomfortable with because it makes you feel complete. In other words, opposites both attract and repel, depending upon the circumstances. It can end up being a very stable relationship, but it also has the potential to be very dull and boring, especially when implied mutual consent banishes certain emotions from the relationship.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A few years ago, I was asked to present a lecture on the subject The Power of Positive Emotions. It was only a 30-minute talk.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But I spent more time working on that 30-minute lecture than I often put into a multi-day program for a large corporation. And there were two reasons for this: the person presenting before me was Richard Simmons, and the person coming on stage immediately after me was Naomi Judd. I was well aware that nobody cared about me. They had no idea who I was. They had virtually no interest in what I had to say. I had been hired by the organizers of a large health fair to bridge the gap between this light- hearted, ‘fun’ presentation of Simmons, cavorting about the stage in his pink and white shorts and tank top, and the very serious, spiritual message of Naomi Judd. The organizers estimated that it would take about 30 minutes to change the set – and my job was to keep the audience entertained in the meantime.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Actually, that was not really the problem. That was a challenge and, I might add, fun to deal with. The real difficulty was trying to decide which emotions belonged in the positive column and which in the negative column. I couldn’t figure it out. Oh, I read the same books you’ve probably read, but I couldn’t agree with the authors. And then one morning when I was out riding my bicycle, I had one of those ‘Aha’ moments. It suddenly dawned on me that there is no such thing as a positive emotion. All emotions are negative. And then I realized that there are no negative emotions. They are all positive. It is not the emotion that is positive or negative. It is the context in which it arises. It is the match between the emotion and the circumstance that determines whether the same emotion can now have survival value or whether it will be destructive to your health. Let’s consider a couple of examples.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Anger is very often placed in the negative column, which it most certainly is when that anger is repressed, or when the anger, which should be expressed to a co -worker or supervisor in the work-place, is taken home and misdirected at your children or your spouse. Yes, that anger is then a very negative emotion. But, if you use anger to motivate you to identify the underlying, unmet need or problem, and, if you express anger in an appropriate way, that anger becomes a virtue, not a vice.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Conversely, the emotion of love is routinely placed in the positive column, which it most certainly is when directed at your children, parents, or your spouse. But, when that same emotion of love is now directed at the spouse of your next-door neighbor, it becomes a very negative, destructive emotion. So is the expression of love that you find depicted in many Valentine’s Day cards, the ones that proclaim, “I couldn’t live without you.” “I love you so much that my life would not be complete if you were not a part of it.” This, I believe, is a very sick, co-dependent type of love, which fails to provide the individuals in the relationship the opportunity to grow. If you delve into history and literature, you discover that what happened to Romeo and Juliet was the rule, not the exception. That kind of dependent love gets people imprisoned in castles, run over by trains, and murdered - that’s if they don’t commit suicide first.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The same is true of your beliefs. There is no such thing as a good or bad belief. It is only when a belief is not justified under a particular set of circumstances that it becomes bad. So, like the emotions that they can give rise to, it is the match between a belief and the environment that has to be examined. Even though beliefs and emotions are distinct entities, realize that the belief gives rise to an emotion, which, in turn, communicates through chemicals with the rest of the body.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Thus, when you change a belief, it will most likely evoke simultaneous changes in your emotional well-being, your body chemistry, and your health. Through the examination of your beliefs, you can take control and make progress toward achieving your dreams.</p>
